 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.562   TIME= 18:35:00
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.000   TIME= 18:35:07
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UX   
 degree of freedom of node 4402) which may indicate a numerically        
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.                   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      11.141   TIME= 18:35:12
 Element 536 (type = 6, SOLID186) (and maybe other elements) has become  
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 incrementing the load more slowly (increase the number of substeps or   
 decrease the time step size).  You may need to improve your mesh to     
 obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  Also consider the behavior  
 of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint equations.  Please rule  
 out other root causes of this failure before attempting rezoning or     
 nonlinear adaptive solutions.  If this message appears in the first     
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.

 Solution not converged at time 0.1 (load step 1 substep 1).             
  Run terminated.

 The unconverged solution (identified as time 1 substep 999999) is       
 output for analysis debug purposes.  Results should not be used for     
 any other purpose.
